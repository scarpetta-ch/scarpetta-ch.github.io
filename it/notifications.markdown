1.	You can put in as many notifications as you like.

2.	I would recommend that you separate them with *** as this will put in a nice horizontal line.
Example: 
	We will be closed for Christmas
	***
	We have no more chocolate cake because john ate it all 

3.	If you want to make any words in your notifications bold or italic, you can do the following:
	We will be closed for *Christmas* (surrounding the words with ONE * will make it italic)
	*** 
	We have no more chocolate cake because **John ate it all** (surrounding words with TWO * will make it bold)
	
4.	To link to a menu from the text, simply surround the text you want as the link with [ ] and follow this with (/menus/name-of-your-menu.pdf) Example:
	Click [here](/menus/MENU_nuova.pdf) to see our menu
Obviously your menu has to exist in the menus folder in github 

	
You can put your notifications directly below this line {% endcomment %}
